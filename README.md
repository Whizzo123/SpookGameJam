# SpookGameJam

Coding Conventions:-

1. Use CamelCase (Variables => myVariable, Functions => MyFunctions & Classes => My_Class)
2. Use brackets on all selection blocks
3. Try to avoid comments use clean and concise code instead
4. Good naming conventions

Engine Conventions:-

1. Ordering in the hierarchy
2. Put stuff in folders based on purpose

Fix layout crash:-

1. Delete current layout under Library folder in "...SpookGameJam\Library\CurrentLayout-default.dwlt"
2. Create another empty project in unity then close it
3. Go into that empty projects library folder and copy its current layout tile (NewUnityProject\Library\CurrentLayout-default.dwlt)
4. Paste this file back into SpookGameJam\Library folder then restart unity and the issue should be fixed
